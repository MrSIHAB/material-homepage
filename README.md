## Introduction

Material Homepage is a sleek browser extension that transforms your New Tab or homepage into a productivity dashboard inspired by Google's Material Design. It provides a minimalist and distraction-free environment, perfect for users seeking an organized and efficient start to their browsing sessions.

Upon installation, Material Homepage replaces your default New Tab with a customizable dashboard that offers quick access to frequently used websites, applications, and search functionalities. The design emphasizes simplicity and usability, creating a professional yet inviting space.

Customization is straightforward, allowing you to add, edit, or remove shortcut sites. You can organize these shortcuts into responsive grids that adapt to your needs, making your New Tab both personal and efficient.

The extension also features dynamic theme personalization with a color picker, which automatically switches between light and dark modes based on the selected color's brightness. You can easily toggle and save your preferences locally. The integrated search bar supports instant queries and direct URL navigation, while a built-in Translator widget provides quick translations of text and webpages using Google Translate.
